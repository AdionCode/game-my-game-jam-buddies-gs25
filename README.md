## About this game

My Game Jam Buddies is your not-so-idle desktop game that simulates the "real life experience" of joining game jams without the stress of actually making a game.

Choose a jam and let your buddies "work" while you do your real-life tasks (or accidentally scroll for 30 minutes, we‚Äôve all been there).

As the jam runs in real time, small interactive mini-tasks will pop up occasionally. Complete them to earn a bit of experience and some coins.

Experience helps level up your studio and unlocks new companions. Coins can be spent in the shop to buy cool cosmetic items like Deadline Slayer: Edge of the Final Crunch!!

It‚Äôs a game about making games while not really making games. Somewhere between a productivity tool and a coping mechanism.

## Features

* A Pomodoro-ish System - so you feel productive while doing your actual work.. well, kinda
* Studio Leveling - Unlock new companions as your studio levels up. Progression! Yay!
* A lot of minitasks you can do (Like 4, maybe 5 if you're lucky)
* Made in classic "I'm doing my best" doodle style with love, passion, and questionable design choices
* Added boss fight (‚Ä¢Àï ‚Ä¢„Éû.·êü)

## Control
